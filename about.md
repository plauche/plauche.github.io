Hi, I'm Ryan Plauche. I'm a software engineer by trade and a curious human by nature. 
Click [here](/background) to see more details about my technical background.

This site is meant to serve as a place where I can explore interesting ideas or problems
that I have encountered or want to dig into.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, interesting ideas to discuss, or
interesting work to collaborate on.
