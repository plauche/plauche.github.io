My history with software began sometime in middle school. My parents noticed my interest
in computers and in an attempt to harness those interests they enrolled me in a QBasic course.
Somehow my video game addled mind caught on and years later I ended up studying Software 
Engineering at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/).

At this point I'm pretty convinced that I ended up in the right trade. In the past I have
worked on open source satellite software, embedded software for automotive GPS units
and inventory scanners, and even did a DevOps stint at a local university.

I love the feeling of a project completed well and thoroughly enjoy building quality software
with good people. I am in my element in Linux and when working on systems-level software.
I prefer to use Rust, C, or Python. However I have a nagging interest in learning
Ada and Erlang.

I am currently exploring the possibility of taking a "career break" and pursuing
a Masters in Computer Science. If you think that is an awful idea then give me a shout!

I'm open to opportunities for part-time work either on a contract or on-going basis.
